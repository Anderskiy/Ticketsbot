# Ticketsbot
In this bot, a ticket system has been developed, that is, channels for suggestions and complaints. A small guide on how to use it:

 1. Open your *cmd* and write: pip install disnake/time/asynsio;
 2. Open your application page and in the "bot" category select the "reset token" item, then copy the token and paste it into the config.py file;
 3. In the main folder, I left a banner sample and its psd file, which you can change and insert the photo url into the code at your discretion;
 4. In the application, select OAuth2, after URL Generator. There, create a link to the bot and invite him to your server (you must include the bot and applications.commands item)
 5. Run main.py
